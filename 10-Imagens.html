    <p>After <mark>World War II</mark> ,  <strong>Lamborghini</strong>  founded a business making tractors from reconfigured surplus military machines, near Bologna, Italy. He later expanded into other ventures, including manufacturing air-conditioning and heating systems, and grew rich. Lamborghini's success enabled him to purchase a variety of luxury sports cars, including a Ferrari, considered one of the top cars of the time. After experiencing mechanical difficulties with his Ferrari, <strong>Lamborghini</strong>  decided to start his own rival sports car company, even hiring a former top <strong>Ferrari</strong>  engineer. Automobili Lamborghini was officially established in 1963 in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, and the same year debuted its first car, the <strong>Lamborghini</strong>  350 GTV, a two-seater coupe with a V12 engine.</p>

    <p>The company's logo featured a bull, a reference to <i>Ferruccio Lamborghini's</i>  zodiac sign, Taurus the bull. Various <strong>Lamborghini</strong>   models had names related to bulls or bullfighting, including the Miura (named for Don <i>Eduardo Miura</i> , a breeder of fighting bulls), a mid-engine sports car that was released in mid-1960s and gained <strong>Lamborghini</strong>  an international following among car enthusiasts and a reputation for prestige and cutting-edge design.</p>

    <p>It sits unremarkably in a gray safe in a climate-controlled room: the first ledger of the <strong><i>Porsche</i></strong>  design office, stored in a fireproof room in the archive of the Porsche Museum. In the timeworn ledger one can find order number 1, placed on August 21, 1930. The job involved manufacturing individual components for a “Hesselmann engine,” a cross between a diesel and a gas engine—a sign of the company's innovative spirit since its inception. Order number 7 was of another dimension altogether. “Small-car project,” reads the description in the ledger. The Wanderer company planned to motorize the masses and needed a concept with which it could economically and inexpensively develop what was then considered a luxury item into a Volks-Wagen—a car for the people. A clever idea, as history would demonstrate. The order book provides an illuminating look at how <mark>Ferdinand</mark>  Porsche and his small team of just nineteen employees embodied the vision of design creativity.</p>

    <p>On April 25, 1931, Professor Porsche had his company officially entered in the commercial register. From that day forward, <mark>“Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH, Konstruktionen und Beratung für Motoren und Fahrzeuge,”</mark>  based in Stuttgart, was officially on the books. The first five projects were started in 1930 in St. Ulrich, Austria. The drawing board was in the bedroom of <strong>Porsche</strong> 's son Ferry. But the office moved to Stuttgart at the beginning of 1931, initially renting space in the city center. The idea of a neutral design office was still unheard of in the automotive world. <i>Ferdinand Porsche</i>  did not, at the time, harbor the intention of building his own cars. His aim was to carry out technical projects for a variety of clients as well as charge licensing fees and patent royalties. The first order book illustrates in impressive fashion how the <strong>Porsche</strong>  office became a hotbed of innovation for the German automotive industry.</p>
